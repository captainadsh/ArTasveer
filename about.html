						<h4>I was caught up in a web of negativity and needed someone or something to help me to escape.</h4>
						<p>Photographs are a way of preserving a moment in our lives for the rest of our lives. Many of us have at least been tempted at the flashy array of photo printers which seemingly leap off the shelves at even the least tech-savvy. It surely seems old fashioned to talk about 35mm film and non-digital cameras in today’s day and age. To our children, cameras not so feature rich with LCD screens and built in Wi-Fi is as foreign as Atari. However, the innovation of home photo printing is bringing about a new way of preserving our most precious memories. Not only do we have digital copies to keep with us for the rest of our days across hundreds of different archives.</p>

	 								    amazing experience When getting used to the command-line, Linux novices are often put off by other, more advanced text editors such as vim and emacs. While they are excellent programs, they do have a bit of a learning curve. Enter Nano, an easy-to-use text editor that proves itself versatile and simple. Nano is installed by default in Ubuntu and many other Linux distros and works well in conjunction with sudo, which is why we love it so much.
